# MIDDLE
Middle is a game where you have to stop a moving box exactly in the square drawn. The game initially starts out easy with the box moving at a slow speed and the square being being. However, as you move up the level the square becomes smaller and the box moves faster. 

Do you have what it takes to be the number 1?
